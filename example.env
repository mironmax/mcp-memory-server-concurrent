# MCP Memory Server Configuration

# Host directory to mount for persistent storage
# This directory on your host machine will be mapped to /app/data inside the container
# The memory.jsonl file will be created/stored in this directory
# Default: ./data (relative to docker-compose.yml location)

# Number of top matching entities to select per query token
# Higher values = more entities per concept, more comprehensive results
# Lower values = fewer entities per concept, more focused results
# Range: 1-5 recommended
# Default: 1
SEARCH_TOP_PER_TOKEN=1

# Minimum relative score threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Entities must score at least this percentage of the best match per token
# Higher values = only keep very similar matches, stricter filtering
# Lower values = include more diverse matches, looser filtering
# Example: 0.3 means keep entities scoring ≥30% of top match
# Range: 0.0-1.0
# Default: 0.3
SEARCH_MIN_RELATIVE_SCORE=0.3

# Maximum path length (hops) when finding connections between entry nodes
# Higher values = find longer connection chains, more intermediate nodes
# Lower values = only direct connections, fewer intermediate nodes
# Range: 1-10 recommended
# Default: 5
SEARCH_MAX_PATH_LENGTH=5

# Maximum total nodes to return in final result (safety cap)
# Higher values = more comprehensive context, higher token usage
# Lower values = more focused results, lower token usage
# Range: 10-100 recommended
# Default: 50
SEARCH_MAX_TOTAL_NODES=50
